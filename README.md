AlbumTracker:
<ul>
  <li>These are screenshots of the final product of a web app I built from scratch using the Django Framework (the actual code is in a private repository). I'm particularly proud of it because it's the best-looking thing I've ever made. The app allows a user to enter information about albums they've listened to, which is then saved to a database.</li>
</ul>
Checkbook Web App (technically its own repository):
<ul>
  <li>This Web App allows a user to create "accounts," under a first and last name, representing bank balances, and to track deposits to and withdrawals from those accounts.</li>
</ul>
Web Page Generator:
<ul>
  <li>A Tkinter window that allows a user to create basic HTML pages that display text of their choosing.</li>
</ul>
Text-Based Game:
<ul>
  <li>About as boring and inoffensive as these games come, by choosing to play it you set yourself up to either die of boredom or ascend to a higher, more enlightened plane of blissful and fulfilling life.</li>
</ul>
