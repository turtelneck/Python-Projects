# AlbumTracker Web App | Django Framework

These are screenshots of the final product of a web app I built from scratch using the Django Framework (the actual code is in a private repository). It might be the best-looking thing I've ever made. The app allows a user to enter information about albums they've listened to, which is then saved to a database.
